# Overview

Telegram Mini App, where unique domain names are published. Users can explore and buy domain names from Space ID. We used Streamr to generate and publish unique domain names. Our app subscribes to the stream and shows it on the frontend, where the user can check the availability to buy on Space ID. It is hard to find good domain names, and where there is one that comes to mind, it is always taken. With AI, we can find domain names we never thought about.

# Folder structure

- backend: bun + elysiajs for fetching domain names and check availability on Space ID
- capturer: subscriber server to store new domain names
- generator: publisher of new domain names generated with Llama 2 to Streamr
- webapp: Telegram Mini App Interface to access the service
